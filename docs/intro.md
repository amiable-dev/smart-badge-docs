# Welcome to SmartBadge Documentation

**SmartBadge** is the next generation of GitHub repository badges, powered by semantic intelligence. Unlike traditional badges that only show basic statistics, SmartBadge understands what your code *actually does* and provides meaningful insights through AI-powered semantic analysis.

## What makes SmartBadge different?

### 🧠 Semantic Intelligence
- **True Understanding**: Goes beyond file counting to understand code purpose and functionality
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically categorizes projects by their actual purpose (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.)
- **Framework Detection**: Intelligently identifies frameworks and technologies, even in complex polyglot projects

### ⚡ 30-Second Setup
```bash
# Add a badge to your README in seconds
