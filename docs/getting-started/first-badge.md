# Your First Badge

Step-by-step guide to creating your first SmartBadge.

## Step 1: Choose Your Repository

SmartBadge works with any public GitHub repository. For your first badge, try using:
- Your most active project
- A well-documented repository
- A project that represents your primary technology stack

## Step 2: Generate the Badge

Visit our [Interactive Badge Generator](../interactive/badge-generator) and:

1. Enter your repository in the format `owner/repo`
2. Select "Semantic Analysis" for your first badge
3. Choose the "flat" style (recommended for beginners)
4. Keep the default blue color

## Step 3: Copy and Paste

The generator will create markdown code like this:

```markdown
[![Semantic Analysis](https://smartbadge.io/badge/your-org/your-repo/semantic.svg)](https://smartbadge.io)
```

Copy this code and paste it at the top of your README.md file.

## Step 4: Verify and Commit

1. Preview your README locally or on GitHub
2. Verify the badge displays correctly
3. Commit your changes to see the live badge

Congratulations! You've successfully added semantic intelligence to your repository. ðŸŽ‰
